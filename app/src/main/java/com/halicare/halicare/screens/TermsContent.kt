Welcome to HaliCare. By using this app, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before using our services.

Purpose of the App
The app helps patients find clinics, view services, and check operational status.
We do not provide medical treatment directly. All medical services are offered by the clinics themselves.

Eligibility
You must be at least 18 years old to use the app.
If you are under 18, you may only use the app under the supervision of a parent or guardian.

Patient Responsibilities
Use the app for personal, non-commercial purposes only.
Ensure that the information you provide (e.g., name, contact details) is accurate and up to date.
Do not misuse the app by posting false information, offensive content, or attempting to disrupt services.

Clinic Information
The app displays clinic details such as location, services, and hours of operation.
We make efforts to keep information accurate, but we cannot guarantee 100% accuracy since clinics update their own data.
Always confirm directly with the clinic before seeking medical services.

No Emergency Services
This app is not a replacement for emergency services.
If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call your local emergency number or go to the nearest hospital immediately.

Privacy & Data Use
We collect only the information needed to provide the service (e.g. location for showing nearby clinics).
Your data will be kept confidential and not shared with clinics or third parties without your consent, unless required by law.

Limitation of Liability
We are not responsible for the quality of services provided by clinics.
We are not liable for any medical outcomes, injuries, or damages resulting from your choice to visit a clinic listed on the app.
Account Suspension or Termination
We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms, misuse the app, or engage in fraudulent activities.

Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms & Conditions from time to time.
Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated terms.
